# GridBuddy MATLAB Simulator

This folder contains a MATLAB-based simulator used to emulate GridBuddy’s solar microgrid behavior (e.g., PV generation, battery dynamics, and load shedding) without requiring live hardware. It was built to quickly test control logic and visualize system state in a repeatable environment.

## What it includes
- Interactive **MATLAB App/UI** to run the simulation and view system status
- A simple microgrid model (solar input → battery → loads) with configurable scenarios
- Simulation outputs for validating behavior (e.g., SoC trends, charge/discharge, load-shedding events)
